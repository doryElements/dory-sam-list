Dory Service Application Mapping Form Editor

## Install the Polymer-CLI

First, make sure you have the [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Then run `npm run dev-install` to install all global dependencies to run your application locally.

## Viewing Your Web Components Demo

```
$ npm run dev
```

## Test Your Web Components

```
$ npm run test
```


## Building Your Application

```
$ polymer build
```

This will create a `build/` folder with `bundled/` and `unbundled/` sub-folders
containing a bundled (Vulcanized) and unbundled builds, both run through HTML,
CSS, and JS optimizers.

You can serve the built versions by giving `polymer serve` a folder to serve
from:

```
$ polymer serve build/bundled
```

## Running Tests

```
$ polymer test
```

Your application is already set up to be tested via [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester). Run `polymer test` to run your application's test suite locally.
